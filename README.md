VIRUS PRODUCER: S       T          A         R
 
FIRST UPDATE CMD
TURN ON VIRUS AS ADMINISTRATOR. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL HAPPEN LATER,
BUT THE COMPUTER MAY CRASH. YOU MUST BE QUICK FOR THAT. OPEN THE PYTHON FILE IT WILL ASK FOR YOUR NAME AND SURNAME.
YOU CAN USE YOUR FAKE NAME AND SURNAME OR YOU CAN USE YOUR REAL NAME (DON'T WORRY, I WILL NEVER KNOW THIS).
THEN IT WILL SHOW THE FILE LOCATION. FROM THERE YOU CAN REMOVE THE VIRUS.


NOTE: OPEN THE CMD VIRUS FIRST. DO NOT OPEN THE PYTHON FILE FIRST
